# Anxiety & Depression Analysis During COVID-19

## Motivation

As the world becomes more dynamic, anxiety and depression have surged, with many people, including myself, affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis seeks to understand the changing rates of anxiety and depression in the U.S., focusing on various demographic factors. This topic is personal to me as I experienced mental health challenges during the pandemic and want to shed light on this issue.

## Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health issues, especially among adolescents. This study analyzes anxiety and depression trends over time, taking into account factors like age, gender, ethnicity, and disability status in the U.S. Using data from the [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Indicators-of-Anxiety-or-Depression-Based-on-Repor/8pt5-q6wp), we aim to explore:

- The relationship between anxiety and depression
- How these mental health issues vary across age groups
- The impact of the pandemic on anxiety and depression trends
- How race and disability affect these rates

## Data

The dataset contains information on anxiety and depression indicators across the U.S. from May 2020 to April 2022. It includes:

- Groups: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and state-level data
- Indicators: Symptoms of anxiety and depression
- 50 U.S. states and data on people with/without disabilities
- 9,918 rows and 14 columns

## Research Questions

1. How are levels of anxiety and depression related?
2. How do anxiety and depression vary by age group?
3. When were the levels of anxiety and depression highest during the pandemic?
4. What role does race play in anxiety and depression trends?
5. How does disability status impact these trends?

## Hypotheses

- Higher anxiety levels may lead to higher depression levels.
- Younger age groups may experience higher rates of depression.
- Anxiety and depression likely peaked during the height of the pandemic.
- Disabled people may have experienced greater changes in mental health during COVID-19.

## Methodology

To address these questions, I will use data visualization techniques like line plots, bar charts, and time series graphs. By segregating data based on age, ethnicity, disability status, and time, we can visually explore the relationships between these variables.

## Goals

This project aims to provide insights into how mental health trends have evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the hope that the findings will inform public health interventions and policies.
